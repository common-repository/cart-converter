== Description ==

= Recover Abandoned Carts in Woo Commerce  =
Woo Commerce is a fantastic way to start selling through your existing WordPress site but it doesn't have a built-in cart abandonment system. What's a cart abandonment system I hear you ask? Well, fill up your cart on any good e-commerce site, get all the way to checkout and then leave the site. You *should* get an email from them inviting you to return to the site and complete your purchase. This simple act of emailing customers who've left the site can deliver stacks of extra cash from what would otherwise have been lost. Don't have a cart abandonment solution for your Woo Commerce store yet? Get setup with Cart Converter today. It's free and takes minutes! 

= Generate an extra 10-30% in Revenues =
